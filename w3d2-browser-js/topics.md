# Client-side Javascript (a.k.a. Return of the Browser)

* Welcome to client-side JS!
    - We'll briefly dial it back to ES5...
    - ...but we can use most of ES6 (unless you like IE or Safari)
    - We'll talk about Javascript, and ONLY Javascript (no jQuery right now)

* The browser
    * The navigator object
    * The window object
    * The document object
        * DOM

* Events and event propagation
    * The event object

* Using DevTools
    * The REPL
    * Elements tab
    * Sources tab
