# Client-side app structure: routing and models

## Client-side routing with `react-router`

We're all familiar with server-side routing like we do in Express with `app.get('/path', ...)` and so on. That kind of routing is very easy to reason about, since each request results in exactly one response and that's it.

Client-side routing in frameworks like React is a bit different, since the whole application usually only loads once (it's a **single-page** application after all).

Originally this meant two things:

1. The location (URL) bar in the browser _never_ changed
2. The back button was completely broken (e.g. pressing back exits the app)

To fix these problems you need something in your app to link URLs to components, and [`react-router`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy) is the most popular way to achieve this in React.

React-router is very effective, but it's also **nothing** like client-side routing. Techincally there's **no** centralized place to put your routes - you can sprinkle them all through your app! ðŸ˜±

This results in a lot of flexibility, but it can also become quite confusing. Be sure to check the main [`<App>`](code/client/src/components/App.jsx) component on the [included code](code) and also [`<Products>`](code/client/src/components/Products.jsx) to see an example of a route embedded within a component. [`<ProductDetails>`](code/client/src/components/ProductDetails.jsx) has an example of the `<Redirect>` component in action.

The [project documentation](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) is very good and contains plenty of examples, but a quick summary doesn't hurt:

* You'll use `<Switch>` and `<Route>` to match URLs to components you want to render
* `<Link>` does pretty much the same as `<a href>`
* `<Redirect>` will send the user to the specified URL when rendered

## Client-side models

It's very common to see client-side apps written by beginners using `$.ajax()` or `fetch()` directly inside React components, but that isn't a particularly good practice. The best way to do that is to modularize your API access and create client-side models. For practical examples with plenty of comments, take a look at [`api.js`](code/client/src/models/api.js) and [`resource.js`](code/client/src/models/resource.js) in the `/client` folder of the [example code](code).

These modules allow you to interact with your API like this...

```js
ProductStore.findAll()
.then((result) => this.setState({products: result.data, errors: null}))
.catch((errors) => this.setState({errors: errors}))
```

...instead of spaghettifying your app like this:

```js
const options = {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: new Headers(),
  mode: 'cors',
  cache: 'default'
}
fetch('http://localhost:8080/products', options)
.then((response) => response.text())
.then((body) => JSON.parse(body))
.then((parsed) => this.setState({products: parsed.data.data, errors: null}))
.catch((errors) => this.setState({errors: errors}))
```

## What about authentication?

Request-response applications usually rely on cookies for authentication, but we can't to that when the server is _completely_ seperated from the client. The most usual way to authenticate/authorize users on SPAs is by using tokens.

There are several ways to do this, but the workflow usually goes like this:

- A special route on your server will receive your authentication arguments (username and password, for example) and generate a unique token. The token is just a long string of characters that can be used by the server to find the user again. One of the ways to do this is storing it as a column on the users table. **Bear in mind that tokens should expire!** The usual practice is expiring tokens in a few hours.

- The client app receives and stores this token in a cookie or other local storage. From that point onwards, this token should be included in your request headers. Usually this header is called `Authorization`. If this header isn't deteced in the server, the request isn't athenticated and you should return an error (conventionally `403 Unauthorized`).

One of the most popular token standards these days is JSON Web Tokens - [JWT](https://jwt.io) for short. There are multiple JWT libraries ready to go for both servers and clients in multiple languages.

Also note that this kind of authentication will _only_ be safe if your app is served over HTTPS. But it's 2018 and you should have HTTPS no matter what ([hint](https://letsencrypt.org/)).

## About the code

To demonstrate the complete separation between client and server, we actually have **two** servers that can be used with the client-side app without any changes!

* [The first is coded in JS](code/js-server) and is based on an express boilerplate called [BAAAAES](https://github.com/fzero/baaaes). Start it with `npm start` as usual. **NOTE:** this server is currently configure to use Postgres, so read the code and configure it properly!
* [The second is a Rails server](code/rails-server) created with `rails new --api`. You should start it with `bin/rails s -p 8080` so the client application can find it. It uses sqlite3, so you should be ready to go no matter what. Don't forget to run `bundle install && bin/rake db:setup` before spinning the server.

Both servers implement the same routes and are configured with [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) support.
