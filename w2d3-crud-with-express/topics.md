# CRUD over HTTP with Express - forms and more

We'll use a very minimal Express server (simpler than the one created with
`express-generator`!) to implement a simple application with a (mostly) complete
workflow, including pages and forms.

* Implementing CRUD over HTTP with Express
  * Using what we've discussed about REST
* Render vs Redirect pattern in multi-page apps
* Forms (action, method)
* Links (`<a>` tags) compared to Forms
* Exploring the DevTools network tab in Chrome
* Explore the full lifecycle of GET -> Submit Form -> POST -> Redirect -> GET
* Query string params vs Post Data params (and how they are encoded)
* Express debugging tactics
