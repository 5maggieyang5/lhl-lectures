# Doing development like a developer

Our first lecture today was on the various tools that are going to make up your toolkit for the time you are a student at Lighthouse Labs. The three tools we focused on today include:

* Vagrant
* Sublime / Atom
* git

We also went over an outline of the curriculum and talked about the various ways that Lighthouse will be evaluating your progress as a student. [Here is a link to those slides](https://www.dropbox.com/s/594thppzdquilkk/W1D1%20-%20Afternoon%20Web%20-%20Sept052016.pdf?dl=1)

## Tools

### [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

When it comes to [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), this is our development environment. It is the operating system, libraries, and encapsulated workspace in which we will work on projects for a particular company or for a particular piece of software. It is common to have many vagrant machines (virtual machines inside your OS) for various projects, and developers can be expected to have to set up a virtual machine when joining a new company.

### [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) / [Atom](https://atom.io/)
Sublime (or alternatively Atom) is our main code editor, that is going to do some important things for us, such as (but not limited to):

* Syntax highlighting
* Multiple file editing (tabbed editor)
* cmd-T to find files in our projects
* Automatically update to reflect changes on disk

### git

The git utility was written by Linus Torvalds to support development of the Linux kernel. It is a Version Control System (VCS) which allows us to keep track of changes to our projects and efficiently collaborate with others on the work. We went over a number of features of git, including:

* `git init`
* `git add`
* `git status`
* `git commit`
* `git checkout -b branchname`
* `git checkout master`
* `git merge branchname`
* `git branch`
* `git remote add origin`
* `git push origin master`
* `git pull origin master`
