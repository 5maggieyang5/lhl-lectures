# Rails + Rspec

* First a bit of opinion: setting up Rails
  * Turbolinks gets in the way big time
  * Nobody cares about Coffeescript anymore
  * Even with `byebug`, `pry-rails` is still desirable
* Setting up Rspec
  * Additional tools:
    * `shoulda-matchers`
    * `database_cleaner`
    * `faker`
    * `factory_girl`
  * Are they 100% needed? No. But they make your life easier
* Rails 5 note: controller tests are not fashionable anymore
