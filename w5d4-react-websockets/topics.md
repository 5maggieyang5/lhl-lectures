# React & Websockets

* We're working on a simple implementation of the Chatty app
* We'll take the simple websockets approach we have and we'll extend it with different types of messages
  * Notification messages
    * "User has changed name"
    * Maybe implement commands, like in Slack or IRC (`/slap`, `/part` etc.)
