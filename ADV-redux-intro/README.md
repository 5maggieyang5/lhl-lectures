# Intro to Redux

[Redux](https://redux.js.org) is a global state management library that can be used (not only) with React. It's a good option for complex applications that require sharing state between components.

The [code discussed in class](todos) is a slightly modified and commented version of the [To Do List example](https://redux.js.org/basics/exampletodolist) on the [Redux docs](https://redux.js.org/basics).
