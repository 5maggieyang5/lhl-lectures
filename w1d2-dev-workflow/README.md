# How do I dev?

Today we've discussed how to break a problem into its constituent parts and use the tools at our disposal to solve it.
This involved using the Node repl, using `console.log` statements, googling a lot and using [`node debug`](https://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html) to run our small application step by step.

The code discussed in class can be found in the [`/code`](code) folder.

## Bonus: PythonTutor

[PythonTutor](http://pythontutor.com) is a nice tool to visualize how our code runs. Despite the name, it can analyze several languages including Javascript.
