# SQL from Javascript

* We'll use the `pg` package, so we're talking to Postgres
* We're not using any additional tools, only plain SQL for now
* Having said that, it's always a good idea to keep things modular
  * Every different kind of data should probably have its own module
* BONUS: promises with `pg-then`
